bugs
-calculated base model slightly off from expected values
-base model doesn't change if run client immediately after make (camera forward vector all NaN)


todo
-incoporate other user input into server logic
-switch server tick to nanoseconds
-need to remove client from sessions when they disconnect
-incorporate camera logic into server logic
-check with game logic on new code in repo

questions
-recv in a loop?
-how server should handle multiple clients (only update and send game state once heard back from everyone?)
    - update no matter what?
-how many packets to handle per client per server loop
    -1 client packet / loop to simplify things?
    -prof says read them all
-what should be done about packets marked with an invalid tick (too far away from actual server tick) 
    - Ignore? Perhaps send a message so client knows that they're off 
    - Once we're only sending changes, we could send full game state at longer intervals in case the client gets out of sync
    -sign that tick needs to be increased
