bugs
-calculated base model slightly off from expected values
-base model doesn't change if run client immediately after make (camera forward vector all NaN)


todo
-incoporate other user input into server logic
-switch server tick to nanoseconds
-need to remove client from sessions when they disconnect
-incorporate camera logic into server logic
-check with game logic on new code in repo

questions
-recv in a loop?
-how server should handle multiple clients (only update and send game state once heard back from everyone?)
-how many packets to handle per client per server loop
